## Retro

[What is a Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)

### Good

* Firestore was relatively simple to set up
* UI went good
* Displaying information stored in Firestore was simple
* Executing queries in Firestore was relatively simple
* We're having a high amount of communication :)
* Members available for meetings

### Bad

* Liboqs is hard
* Firestore was initially confusing therefore took more time to research
* There was a lot of work in everyone's schedules so a lot of time could't be allocated to work on quark.
* Liboqs seems to be more difficult than we initially thought after more research

### Actionable Commitments

* We will work more asynchronously, not just when we meet
* We will look into liboqs more !
* We will dedicate more time to Quark
* We will continue refining our UI 
* We will prioritize completing the functionality for creating individual chats, opening individual chats, sending and receiving messages, and creating new contacts 
* We will conduct regular check-ins to monitor progress and address any challenges promptly
