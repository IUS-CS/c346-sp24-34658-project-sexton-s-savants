[What is a Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)

### Good

* Firebase was easy to setup
* UI went good
* Authentication was pretty easy
* We're having a high amount of communication :)
* Members available for meetings

### Bad

* "I did not make many contributions" -Logan
* Liboqs is hard
* We overcomplicated firebase

### Actionable Commitments

* Logan will work on some UI 
* We will look into liboqs more !
